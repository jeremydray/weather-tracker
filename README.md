## **1.    Introduction**

The goal of this project was to create a lightweight weather forecast app that will give you the current and 5 day forecast for a specified city.

The user will be able to search for a particular city and be presented with the current date and an icon to indicate the current weather status (sunny/cloudy/rain/etc.) and the temperature, wind, and humidity. Below that, it will provide the upcoming 5 day forecast after with the same weather detail. The results will also be saved to a button on the side panel so the user is able to easily switch back and forth between each city search. The user will also have the ability to clear those saved results if desired.
